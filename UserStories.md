# Attendance Management System
What we are attempting to build is an attendance management system, that will allow registered administrators (referred to as admins) to create and manage events, and track the attendance of said events, via web portal and through a CSV file that will be sent to them if they prefer that option. Attendance will be taken via QR code that is scanned from the attendeeâ€™s (referred to as client) device, and then their attendance will be recorded for the event. 

## Core Functionality 
1.	As an administrator, I want to be able to create an event, and record attendance at the event.
2.	As a client, I want to be able to record my attendance at the event.

Results from ChatGPT highlighted in yellow are options it suggested that we are not wanting to implement at this time. They were kept for record, and research purposes.
